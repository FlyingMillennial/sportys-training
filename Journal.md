### Online Training
* Sporty's seems to be the best quality to me.
* 15 minutes of video took about an hour to consume.
* Sporty's module times:
  * One: 128 minutes (8 hours of study)
  * Two: 103 minutes (7 hours of study)
  * Three: 138 minutes (8 hours of study)
  * Four: 179 minutes (12 hours of study)
  * Five: 155 minutes (10 hours of study)
  * Six: 122 minutes (8 hours of study)
  * *Estimate of total time*: 53 hours + Review of 8 hours = About 60 hours
  * Assuming I can study 5 hours per week this will take 12 weeks
