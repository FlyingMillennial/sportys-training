    * Vs1: 50kts - normal configuration stall speed
    * Vr: 60kts - rotation speed for takeoff
    * Vx: 64kts - best climb over distance
    * Vy: 76kts - best climb over time
    * Vfe: 102kts - maximum speed with flaps extended
    * Va: 113kts@2550lbs/89kts@1634lbs - maneuvering speed
    * Vno: 125kts - maximum normal operating speed
    * Vne:  154kts - maximum airspeed (never exceeed)

2. Max gross weight: 2558

3. Max takeoff weight: 2550

4. Fuel Capacity: 50; Usable: 48, Grade: 100ll, blue

5. Oil: Min: 6qts Max: 8qts Grade: 30w50 (Confirm)

6. Compute Center of Gravity
    * Limit @ 2550lbs is 88.6-93.0; @2050&below is 82.0-93.0 

    * Empty weight x arm = moment: 1590 x 87.50 (Confirm) [139125]
    * My Weight x Arm = Moment: 205 x 80.5 [16502.5]
    * Takeoff Fuel Weight x Arm = Moment (2.5 gal burned taxi): 263 x 95.0 [24985]
    * Landing Fuel Weight (10gal burned): 203 - 95.0 [19285]

    * **Takeoff Weight:** 1590 + 205 + 263 = 2058
    * **Takeoff Moment:** 139125 + 16502.5 + 24985 = 180612.5
    * **Takeoff CG:** 180612.5 / 2058 = 87.76 (Good!)

    * **Landing Weight:** 1590 + 205 + 263 = 1998
    * **Landing Moment:** 139125 + 16502.5 + 19285 = 174912.5
    * **Landing CG:** 174912.5 / 1998 = 87.53 (Good!)
