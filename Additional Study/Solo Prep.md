### Presolo Knowledge Test
*Piper Archer - 9341C*

1. Airspeeds
    * Vso: 45kts - landing configuration stall speed
    * Vs1: 50kts - normal configuration stall speed
    * Vr: 60kts - rotation speed for takeoff
    * Vx: 64kts - best climb over distance
    * Vy: 76kts - best climb over time
    * Vfe: 102kts - maximum speed with flaps extended
    * Va: 113kts@2550lbs/89kts@1634lbs - maneuvering speed
    * Vno: 125kts - maximum normal operating speed
    * Vne:  154kts - maximum airspeed (never exceeed)

2. Max gross weight: 2550

3. Max takeoff weight: 2550

4. Fuel Capacity: 50; Usable: 48

5. Oil: Min: 6qts Max: 8qts Grade: ??? (Confirm)

6. Compute Center of Gravity
    * Limit @ 2550lbs is 88.6-93.0; @2050&below is 82.0-93.0 

    * Empty weight x arm = moment: 1590 x 87.50 (Confirm) [139125]
    * My Weight x Arm = Moment: 205 x 80.5 [16502.5]
    * Takeoff Fuel Weight x Arm = Moment (2.5 gal burned taxi): 263 x 95.0 [24985]
    * Landing Fuel Weight (10gal burned): 203 - 95.0 [19285]

    * **Takeoff Weight:** 1590 + 205 + 263 = 2058
    * **Takeoff Moment:** 139125 + 16502.5 + 24985 = 180612.5
    * **Takeoff CG:** 180612.5 / 2058 = 87.76 (Good!)

    * **Landing Weight:** 1590 + 205 + 263 = 1998
    * **Landing Moment:** 139125 + 16502.5 + 19285 = 174912.5
    * **Landing CG:** 174912.5 / 1998 = 87.53

7. What is the takeoff ground roll and the distance over a 50-ft. obstacle for your airplane at your airport with full fuel, a temperature of 29° C, 5-kt. headwind, and an altimeter setting of 29.64?
    * Altitude: 889
    * Pressure altitude = 1150 ft
    * Ground Roll =  800ft
    * Over 50ft Giraffe =  1600ft 

8. What is the ground roll and total landing distance over a 50-ft. obstacle for your airplane at yournairport with full fuel, a temperature of 32° C, calm wind, and an altimeter setting of 30.1 O?
    * Altitude: 889
    * Pressure altitude = 724
    * Ground Roll = 850ft
    * Over 50ft Giraffe = 1275ft

9. What are the indications of carburetor icing? When is carburetor heat recommended to be used in your airplane? 
    * Decreased RPM
    * Engine Running Rough
    * Carb heat on when landing or slow flight or icing is suspected

10. Frequencies
    * ATIS - none, AWOS is 119.425
    * Ground - none
    * Tower - none
    * Approach/Departure - none
    * CTAF - 122.7
    * Unicom - 122.7
    * FSS - 122.3

11. At your airport:
    * What runways are available? - 16/34
    * What is the direction of the traffic pattern for each runway? - left
    * What is the traffic pattern altitude? - 1721ft
    * In what class of airspace is the airport located (list from surface to 19kft)? -  Golf to 700 ft AGL, echo to 2300ft MSL, bravo to 10000ft MSL, echo to 18000ft MSL, Alpha to 19000 and beyond.

12. How do you enter and depart the traffic pattern at your airport? 
    * 45 degrees to downwind leg

13. What radio communication procedures are required at your airport?
    * 10 miles out (what runway you want)
    * Entering downwind
    * Turning base
    * Turning final
    * Clear runway (full stop)
    * Entering downwind (touch and go)

14. Explain the procedures you would use to land at your airport if the communication radio(s) failed. 
    * Watch closely for other aircraft and wait for the pattern to be clear.  Enter pattern and wobble to indicate radio is dead.
