## Test Prep Notes

Notes from the online test prep tool.

* You need a plotter (got it!)
* You need an aviation computer (got it!)

* Altimeter & Temperature: When the temperature goes up, pressure goes down (open system), altimeter reads high.

* LAHSO clearance: Land and hold short clearance given in VFR conditions (1000' ceiling and 3sm vis) and should NOT be used by student pilots

* Cloud height = (((Temperature - Dew Point) / 4.4) * 1000) + elevation

* Lower Pressure = Higher indicated altitude

* Class C Airspace = need 2way radio, transponder, transmitting altimeter

* METARs give wind in true bearings

* VFR in controlled airspace requires 1 horzontal mile from clouds

* Class C Airpsace = 20nm radius

* Weather is caused by heat exchange

* Aircraft towing other aircraft have right of way over all other engine driven aircraft

* Reading airport data sheets - study it!

* Magnetic compass peculiarities when turning - study it!

* Runway numbers are magnetic
