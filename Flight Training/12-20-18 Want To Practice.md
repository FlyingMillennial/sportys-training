## Want to practice 12/20/18

* Forward slips
    * Right rudder turns the nose off of the track across the ground
    * Left aileron banks the airplane and keeps in in it's original track (not following the nose)
    * Added drag allows the airplane to descend more quickly.
* Side slips
    * If I want to center on the runway and I'm off to the left, bank to the right, while using enough left rudder to prevent the aircraft from turning.  The plane will `slip` to the right.  
    * To exit the slip, apply opposite aileron and rudder.
* Descending turns
    * Often you want to pass over an airfield and then descend to pattern altitude and merge with the downwind.
    * Practice: On a north heading at 3500 feet, descend to 3000 feet while turning the long way round to a west heading.
