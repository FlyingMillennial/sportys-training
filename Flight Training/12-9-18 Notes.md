## Flight Lesson Notes

### Stall Recovery
* The goal is to return to a climb quickly, while avoiding a secondary stall.
* You overcorrected for the secondary stall and didn't quickly return to a climb
* Remember to kill carb heat when recovering

### Steep Turns
* Add a couple hundred RMP when initiating the steep turn
* Hold your turn steady, while using forward and back pressure to keep your altitude
* Need to get a better idea of what the attitude indicator should look like for turns

### Corrections on final approach
* You're overcorrecting. Make a small change, then back to neutral, to see what happens.

### Cross controlling
* Cross control is when your ailerons and rudder are working in opposite directions
* As you land with crosswind from the right, you need to apply left rudder to straighten out, but right aileron to keep the wind from pushing you off the runway.

### Next Time
* More Stalls
* More Steep Turns
* Ground Reference Maneuvers

### Study
* Attitude Indicator for turns (how should it look)
* Stall procedures - power on & power off
* Final approach procedures
    * How to react to correcting back to the runway in a crosswind (no overcorrection)
    * When to pull power
    * When to even out with the runway
    * Reacting to a bubble
    * Pull back harder to get it to stall
    * Remember right rudder when you put power back on
