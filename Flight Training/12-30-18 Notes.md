* To drop a bunch of altitude quick, go full flaps and nose the airplane down; it will get up to 80-85kts but not much faster as the flaps add so much drag, then you can pull back to your 65kts and make a normal landing.

* Round out prior to flaring; as you get over the airstrip round up a little bit, then your flare will become much smoother.

* "Dance on the pedals" - instead of being super smooth on the rudder, give it a quicker push in the direction you want the nose to go and let off pressure.  This will decrease your tendency to control too light, then over control.
