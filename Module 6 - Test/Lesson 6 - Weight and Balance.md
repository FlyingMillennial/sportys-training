## Weight and Balance

* Base Weight
    * Plane
    * Engine
    * Permanent Installations
    * Unusable Fuel
    * Oil (most planes)

* Added Weight
    * Usable Fuel (6 lbs/g)
    * People
    * Baggage

* Terms
    * Datum = point you measure arm from
    * ARM = distance of load from Datum
    * Moment = weight * arm ('pound inches' or 'inch pounds')
    * Reduction Factor = 100, 1000 number by which moment is divided to get Moment Index
    * CG = Total Weight / Total Moment

* Lower moment indicates a forward center of gravity, while higher moment indicates an aft center of gravity.
* Plane must be within a moment range at takeoff AND landing (you burn fuel while flying!)
