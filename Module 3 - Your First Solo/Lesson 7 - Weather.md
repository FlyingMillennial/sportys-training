## Weather

* Three Rs
    * Recognize
    * Respect
    * Refrain

* Clouds
    * Layered = Stratus / NimboStratus (if producing precipitation)
        * Smooth FLight
        * Fair to poor visibility
    * Piled Up Vertically = Cumulus / Cumulonimbus (if producing precipitation)
        * Bumpy Flight
        * Good Visibility
        * Unstable air

* Atmosphere
    * Troposphere - uniform temperature decrease as altitude increases
        * Inversion - uniform temperature INCREASE as altitude increase; indicates stable layer
        * Inversions close to surface can cause bad visibility
    * Tropopause
    * Stratosphere - no temperature decrease as altitude increases

* Hazards
    * Fog
        * Adding moisture to the air OR cooling the air causes fog
        * Radiation fog: As land cools off at night, air cools, condensing water
            * THIS is an inversion; it's cooler at the surface than aloft
        * Advection fog: Warm, cool air flows across cooler surface, cooling and condensing
            * Lasts longer, larger area
        * Upslope fog: Moist air hits a barrier, climbs, and condenses.
        * Precip fog: Evaporation from precipitation
        * Fog can form:
            * When the temp and dew point are close
            * Calm or light winds
            * During or after precipitation
            * Close to urban areas
            * Around active cooling processes
    * Thunderstorms
        * Unstable Air + high moisture + lift 
        * Stages: Cumulus (mostly updrafts), Mature (both), Dissipating (mostly downdrafts)
        * Sheer = point where updrafts and downdrafts meet
    * Altimiter variance cause by pressure changes
        * Need to reset altimeter to new weather data a you fly

* Standard day = 59 degress, 29.92" hg
