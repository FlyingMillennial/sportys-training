## Pitot Static System

* Altimiter - barometer
    * Altimeter settings based on sea-level pressure
    * Indicate altitude - approximate height above MSL
    * Pressure altitude - indicated altitude when the pressure is set to 29.92
    * Density altitude - pressure altitude adjusted for non-standard temperature
    * Absolute altitude - real height AGL
    * True altitude - real height ASL
* Air Speed Indicator - measure difference in pressure between pitot tube and static port
    * Indicated - read directly from instrument
    * Calibrated - Indicated corrected for instrument and configuration 
    * True - Calibrated corrected for temp and density (as altitude increase, indicated airspeed decreases)
        * 2% decrease in indicated airspeed per 1000 feet
    * Speeds:
        * Vso = power off stalling speed, flaps down, max weight (start of white line)
        * Vs = power off stalling speed, flaps up, max weight (start of green line)
        * Vfe = full flaps max speed (end of white line)
        * Vno = max structural cruising speed (end of green line)
        * Yellow = smooth air only
        * Vne = never exceed speed
* Vertical Speed Indicator
    * Runs on changes in static air pressure
    * If static port is clogged, there is an alternate static knob to vent to the cabin
