## Thrust and Drag

* When airspeeed is stable, thrust and drag are in equilibrium.

* `Stability`: How well an airplane returns to its original attitude after being disturbed by an outside force.

* Center of Gravity & Center of Lift
    * Center of Gravity is usually forward of center of lift; this makes the airplane recover from stalls better.
    * Countering the nose-heaviness is the horizontal stabilizer, affected by:
        * Wing slipsteam
        * Propeler vortex
        * It's own shape in the wind

* `Dihedral` is the wing tips pointing up a bit

* CG Placement
    * Aft of optimal can make stall recovery more difficult
    * Forward of optimal can make it hard to flare for anding.
