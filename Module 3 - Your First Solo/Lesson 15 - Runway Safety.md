## Runway Safety

* Hold short marking = two dashed and two solid yellow lines.  Hold short of the solid ones.
* ILS Critical area looks like a crosswalk with double, thinner lines.
* Signs with white letters and red backgrounds are at intersections with and between runways
    * A-20: you're at the threshhold of runway 20 on taxiway A
    * A-20-2: you're intersecting a runway on taxiway A; runway 20 is to the left, runway 2 is to the right
* If confused by taxi information, ask for `progressive taxi instructions`
