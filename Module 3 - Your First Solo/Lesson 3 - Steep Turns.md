## Steep Turns

* Load Factors
    * 30 degree turn = 1.15g
    * 45 degree turn = 1.41g
    * 60 degree turn = 2g
    * 70 degree turn = 3g

* Maneuvering speed (Va) = Speed at which the airplane stalls before exceeding the design limit loads

* Fly steep turns at > 1500 ft AGL
* Practical test requires a 360 degree steep turn
