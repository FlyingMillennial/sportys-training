Notes from the online test prep tool.

* You need a plotter
* You need an aviation computer

* Altimeter & Temperature: When the temperature goes up, pressure goes down (open system), altimeter reads low.

* LAHSO clearance: Land and hold short clearance given in VFR conditions (1000' ceiling and 3sm vis)

* Cloud height = (((Temperature - Dew Point) / 4.4) * 1000) + elevation
