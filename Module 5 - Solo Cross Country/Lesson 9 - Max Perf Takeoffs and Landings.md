## Max Perf Takeoffs

* Vx - optimize climb for distance over the ground
* Vy - optimize climb for time
* Ground Effect extends off the ground roughly your wingspan.

* Short Field
    * Takeoff: Breaks on, max power, release breaks stay nose down until you get to Vx, then elevator up and maintain. 
    * Landing: No more than 1.3x full flaps landing speed, land early in runway, breaks on and idle on touchdown.

* Soft Field
    * Takeoff: Attitude up to get front wheel up for acceleration
    * Landing: Attitude up to keep the front wheel up while decelerating
