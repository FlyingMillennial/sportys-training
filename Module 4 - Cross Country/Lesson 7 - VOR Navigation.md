## VOR Navigation

* VOR = Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (Civil) (blue hexagon with a dot)
* TACAN = Tactical Air Navigation (Military)
* VORTAC is a ground based system supporting both VOR and TACAN (blue hexagon with three rectangles with a dot)
* VOR is a combination of Ground and Aircraft signals
* VOR frequency is in a box; underlined means no voice capability

* A course away from a VOR is a `radial` and are indicated with magnetic `bearings`.
* VOR is line of sight
* Frequency is 108.000 to 117.950
* Pull `ident` switch to hear morse code id + voice transmissions, push it to hear just voice.

* VOR Indicator Features
    * Omni Bearing Selector
    * Course deviation indicator - shows where the COURSE is, not the VORTAC facility
    * To/From Indicator (nothing or off indicates no signal)
        * If it says FROM and you're lined up on that heading, you're headed away from the VORTAC
        * If it says TO and you're lined up on that heading, you're headed towards the VORTAC

* To orient yourself:
    * Find a VORTAC on your chart in your general vicinity.
    * Adjust your OBS to a point where it's verticle.
    * You are on a line of the indicated heading either going TO or FROM the VOR, as indicated

* Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) shows how far away you are + ground speed.

* VOR/DME just have VOR and DME, and are a hexagon in a square

* VOR need an accuracy check every 30 days
* Must be within 4 degrees

* VOTs are testing beacons that broadcast 360 degrees in all directions
