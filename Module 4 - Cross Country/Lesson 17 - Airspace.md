## Airspace

* Controlled
    * Alpha
        * 18000 to 60000 feet, must be IFR, must have ATC clearance
    * Bravo (Heavey Blue Lines - Up to 10000 feet)
        * Speed limit below 10000 feet is 250 kts WITHIN Bravo airspace
        * Speed limit underneath bravo airspace is 200 kts
        * Requires ATC authorization
        * Requires an altitude transponder to fly within 30 miles
        * VFR Minimum is 3sm and clear of clouds
    * Charlie (Heavy Magenta Lines - Up to 4000 feet)
        * Communicate with ATC - but clearance is not required
        * Transponder with altitude required
        * VFR Minimum is 3sm, 500 feet below, 1000 feet above, and 2000 feet laterally from clouds
        * 200 kts speed limit within 4nm of charlie or delta primary airport or below 2500 feet AGL
    * Delta (Segmented Blue Lines - Variable Ceiling)
        * Communicate with ATC - but clearance is not required
        * Not always controlled - revert to class echo or golf when tower not in operation
    * Echo (Magenta transparent line - Above 700 feet, outside line, 1200 feet, blue vignetted when abutting class G, segmented magenta line denotes class e to the surface) All other controlled airspace not in ABCD
        * Radio contact not required to fly VFR
        * 3sm visibility and 500 feet below, 1000 feet above, and 2000 feet laterally from clouds (below 10000 feet)
        * 5sm visibility and 1000 feet below, 1000 feet above, and 1sm laterally from clouds (above 10000 feet)
        * 3sm visibility and 1000 feet AGL ceiling required for takeoff and landing VFR 
        * Speial VFR allows visibility down to 1 mile
* Uncontrolled
    * Golf - (Usually below class E around airports or in the middle of nowhere)
        * Vis must be 1sm or 3sm at night below 10000 feet
        * Vis must be 3sm or 5sm at night above 10000 feet
* Special Use
* Other
