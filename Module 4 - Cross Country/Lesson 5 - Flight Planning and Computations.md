## Flight Planning and Computations

* Pilotage = flying by reference to landmarks
* Dead reckoning = compass heading + airspeed to estimate fuel and time
* `true heading` is your crabbed angle to account for the wind that you need to travel on your chosen course.
    * `drift angle`
    * `wind correction angle`
* `isogonic lines` are magenta dotted lines that connect points of equal magnetic variation
    * `agonic line` is the isogonic line on 0 degrees
