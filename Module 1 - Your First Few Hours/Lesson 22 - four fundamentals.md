## Four Fundamentals

### Turns
* Use ailerons to bank, then use rudder pressure to make the plane turn as it begins to bank
* Shallow = < 20 degrees (need to hold the bank)
* Medium = between 20 and 45 degrees (should hold iteself)
* Steep = > 45 degrees (need to hold against further banking)
* Pull up (or add power) to maintain altitude during a turn
* Apply rudder in the direction of the turn to combat adverse yaw
* `Slipping` is when horizontal lift overpowers centrifugal force and you slip towards the turn
* `Skidding` is when centrifugal force overpowers horizontal lift and you skid away from the turn
* `running out of margin` is when you need to add more to a control surface, but it's maxed out.  This is bad.

### Straight & Level
* A specific airspeed requires specific pitch trim and power setting
* Visual references of point on the aircraft to the horizon can be used to monitor attitude and direction
* Attitude indidcator, heading indicator, turn coordinator, altimeter, airspeed, and VSI all tell you something about straight and level flight.


### Climbs
* VSI has a six to nine second lag
* When you start climbing, pull up and increase power simultaneously until you reach desired climbing airspeed.
* Steer with the rudder, not the ailerons
* Start leveling off 50 feet before your desired altitude

### Descents
* VSI has a six to nine second lag
* Glide ratio is about 9:1
* More control pressure is needed in a glide
* Lead level flight by 50 to 100 feet
* Clear engine every 30 seconds (1500 rpm)

* `Normal Glide` is done at idle power
* Decrease airspeed until you get to your optimal glide speed, while increasing elevator pressure to maintain altitude.
* Once you get to you desired speed, trim to the descending pitch you want.
* Constant airspeed at idle power indicates proper pitch;
    * decreasing airspeed requires lower pitch
    * increasing airspeed requires higher pitch
