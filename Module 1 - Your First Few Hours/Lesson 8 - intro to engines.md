## The engine

* Most light aircraft have 4 stroke reciprocating engines

* 4 strokes:
  * Intake - piston drops, draws fuel/air into cylinder
  * Compression - piston rises, compresses fuel/air
  * Power - plugs ignite fuel/air (each cylinder has two)
  * Exhaust - pushes out exhaust

* Baffels = air cooling channels in front of the engine

* Oil
  * Lubricates
  * Cools
  * Carrys junk to the oil filter

* Mineral Oil

* Ashless Dispersent Oil - suspends contaminents for draining

* Sport oil - for rotex engines

* Engines have `dual magnetos` that start the engine, allowing the aircraft to function independently of the electrical system and battery

* Preflight check switches back and forth between magnetos, watching RPM to make sure it doesn't drop too far

* Engines should warm up 4 minutes in warm weather, 6 in cold, prior to takeoff
