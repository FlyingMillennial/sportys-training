## The Cockpit

* Flight Instruments
  * Airspeed Indicator
    * Reads in knots (nautical mile = 6076 feet or 1.15 statute miles)
    * Vne = Redline = never exceed speed
    * Vno = Yellow Arc = smooth air speed
    * Normal Operating Range = Green Arc
    * Flap Operating Range = White Arc
  * Attitude Indicator
    * Shows your pitch and bank relative to the horizon
  * Altimeter
    * Three hands: 100s (short), 1,000s (medium), 10,000s (long)
    * Adjustable per barometric pressure
  * Turn Coordinator
    * Indicates the quality of your turn given the forces on the airplane
  * Heading Indicator
    * Gyroscopically stabilized compass (speed, turns, etc don't affect it)
    * Needs to be set prior to flight and every 15 minutes or so during flight
  * Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)
    * Rate of ascent/descent in feet per minute
  * Tachometer
    * Enginer RPM

* Engine Controls
  * Throttle
    * Forward/In = open
    * Back/Out = closed
  * Throttle friction lock adjusts how hard it is to move the throttle
  * Mixture control
    * Regulates ratio of fuel and air feeding the engine
    * Push in = enrich = more fuel relative to air
    * Pull out = lean = less fuel relative to air

* Engine Instruments
  * Oil Temp + Pressure
  * Fuel flow (gal/hr)
  * Exhaust temp (useful for setting mixture)
  * Fuel Guages
  * Fuel Selector - selects which tank to draw from
  * Fuel shutoff valve

* Control Surfaces
  * Flap Control
    * 10, 20 , 30 degrees "flap deflection"
  * Elevator trim control wheel
    * Forward = nose up
    * Aft = nose down

* Other instruments
  * Vacuum guage - shows that the vacuum pumps are working, which make the attitude indicator and heading indicator work.
  * Voltmeter/Clock/Air Temperature
