## Introduction to the Airplane
* Four Forces
  * Weight (down)
  * Lift (up)
  * Thrust (forward)
  * Drag (backward)
* Airfoil curve is called a 'camber'
* Increase in velocity = Decrease in pressure
  * Since air moves `faster` over the top of the wing, the pressue is decreased
  * Most of your `lift` comes from the lower pressure on top of the wing
  * Some of your `lift` comes from the higher prussre below the wing
* Wing parts
  * Leading edge
  * Trailing edge
  * Chord = Imaginary line between leading edge and trailing edge
  * Upper Camber = top curve
  * Lower Camber = bottom curve
* 3 axises pass through the aircraft's center of gravity
  * Longitudinal = front to back access (through the nose, out the tail)
    * The aircraft `rolls` or `banks` around this axis
  * Lateral = parallel to the wings (through one door, out the other)
    * The aircraft `pitches` in relation to this axis
  * Veritcal = top to bottom (in the bottom, out the top)
    * `yaw` is movement about the vertical axis
* Primary Control surfaces
  * Ailerons
    * Once in a bank and the ailerons are neutral, the plane stays in the bank
  * Elevator
  * Rudder
    * `Adverse yaw` occurs in a bank because the higher wing has greater drag, which pulls the nose of the aircraft in the opposite direction of the bank.  The rudder compensates for this.
* `Trim Tabs` reduce the force needed to hold a control surface out of the neutral position
* `Flaps` increase both drag and lift, allowing for slower landings and quicker takeoff
