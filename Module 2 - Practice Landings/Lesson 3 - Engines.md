## Engines

* Mixture richness = Fuel Quantity / Air Quantity
* Air Quantity = 1/Altitude
* Therefore, you need to decrease Fuel Quantity as you ascend to maintain mixture richness
* That's called `leaning` - and should be done above 3000 feet in a skyhawk
* Lean at 75% to 80% power, but never above
* `Peak EGT`: Leaning will increase Exhaust Gas Temp until a point, after which it will drop again
* In a skyhawk, you lean with mixture control 50 degrees rich of peak egt 
* If there is no EGT Gauge, lean until the engine runs rough, then enrich until it runs smooth
* Use full rich for takeoff and climb

## Engine Issues
* Detonation: cylinder temp/pressure ignites the mixture suddenly and violently instead of consistent combusion
    * Caused by wrong fuel, slow flight, or overly rich mixture
    * Detected by a sudden loss of power
* Preignition: Ignition occurs prior to the power stroke.
    * Caused by glowing spark plugs from detonation heat
    * Detected by a loss of power
* Spark plug fouling can be cause by overly rich mixtures
* Enrich mixture and reduce power if these issues are suspected

## Tips
* When in doubt, run a little richer
