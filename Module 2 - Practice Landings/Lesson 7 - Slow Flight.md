## Slow flight

* Always practice slow flight above 1500 feet AGL

* Region of Reversed Command - Area where you need MORE power to fly slower

* Procedure for slow flight:
    * Decrease power to less than that required for slow flight
    * As airspeed decreases, increase pitch smoothly until you're 15 kts above stall speed
    * Increase power to a point where you're maintaining altitude about 10 kts above stall speed
    * Note power setting, nose position, and trim position at this point
    * Add power in turns during slow flight to maintain altitude

* Adding Flaps - once you're in slow flight:
    * Go to 10 degrees of flaps and some power, removing some pitch (if maintaining altitude)
    * Go to 20 degrees of flaps and some power, removing some pitch (if maintaining altitude)
    * Go to 30 degrees of flaps and some power, removing some pitch (if maintaining altitude)

* To bail out of a landing with full flaps, you cant increase pitch because you'll stall
    * Power to max
    * Decrease flaps 10 degrees at time as your airspeed climbs
