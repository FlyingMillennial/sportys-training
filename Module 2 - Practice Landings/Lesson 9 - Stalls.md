## Stalls

* Recovery steps
    * Reduce angle of attach (nose down)
    * Full power
    * Maintain control

* Load factor = extra force on the aircraft from aggressive maneuvers

* Power-on stall: You're already at max power and have to drop the nose to recover
* Power-off stall: You're not at max power and can increase throttle to recover
* Accelerated stall: Stalls that happen during more aggressive maneuvers
