## Landing

* From 10 miles out:
    * Call airport traffic and state your intention to land
    * Ask for an airport advisory
    * Descend to pattern altitude
* Once in the pattern
    * Slow speed to flaps operation range
    * Opposite the end of the runway, reduce power and hold back elevator pressure
        * This slows you to about 75 kts
        * This will start a descent of about 500 ft/m
    * When the end of the runway is 45 degrees behind you, start your turn base
    * On the base leg you can fine tune your altitude
        * Too high: extend your base leg and make a more steeper turn to final
        * Too low: shorten your base leg and make a shallow turn to final
    * Once on final, flaps are down, and you trim for 65 kts in a skyhawk
    * Follow your flight path to your inteneded landing spot
        * If you're coming up short, increase power and pitch to maintain speed but decrease descent
        * If you're overshoting, decrease power and pitch to maintain speed but increase descent
