## Aerodynamics

* Drag
    * Induced: The force created by the airfoil doesn't go stright up.  The rearward part of the vector is induced drag.
    * Parasite: Any other stuff on the airplane that drags.

* Angle of attack
    * Difference between where the chord of the wind is pointed and the direction the wing is travelling
    * Critical angle of attack is the point where we lose lift sufficient to fly the plane.

* Angle of incidence is the angle at which the wing is attached to the plane

* Wing tip vortex are a byproduct of lift

* Why the plane turns left:
    * Engine torque
    * Spiral slipstream hits the tail on the left side
    * Gyroscopic precession - gyroscope feels a force 90 degrees off from where it's applied
    * P-Factor - asymetric propeller loading - descending side of the blade has more thrust
